# 1337


##What is 1337?
1337 is a spiritual successor to the hacking simulator: Dark Signs Online. Right now, it's being coded in Java for local play. Eventually, it will be moved to an online system, where players will be able to play with and against each other.

##What are the current goals of 1337?
Right now, I'm focused on (In order of priority):

* Finishing up some of the barbones, and more obstract, game assets (Things that a player would do in the game)
* Creating an interface for the game, so it's not a text-only game (By the end of the year, hopefully)
* Continuing to flesh out game more features
* Moving the game to an online base (Sometime early next year, at the earliest)
* Finishing up development of the base game
* Release

##When will it be released?
I really don't know. I'm new to this process, so I honestly can't say how long it will take. It could get done in a matter of months, or be released alongside Half Life 3. It's too early on to talk about release.

##Is it really called 1337?
1337 is just a current placeholder, because Eclipse forced me to name it.
